            <h2>Hey y'all. it's been a minute, hasn't it?   We wanted to share some developments
                 on our end with those of you that are interested.  
                We're making the conscious decision to put smooth Hound Smith as 
                            y'all know it on hiatus for the foreseeable future. 
                Think of this hiatus as more like a gentle abatement, or a fade-out... 
                a sunset into dusk, into night. if you will, rather than say, the flicking off 
                                                          of a light switch. 
                Thank you for letting us play for you at your weddings and parties,
                 and backyard potlucks, for letting our shows be your first dates, 
                 and your 50th anniversaries, and yours 21st birthday parties. 
                For allowing us to be the soundtrack while you drove cross-country with a new love,
                 while you conceived babies, and careened down 
                                        mountains on a bike or snowboard. 
                You've reached  out over the years and told us that you have done 
                these things and more with our music as the backdrop, you've allowed us 
                to be part of it, to be part of your memories, challenges, 
                                                             triumphs. 
                We want you all to know how thoroughly proud we are to have played 
                                           a roll, however minute, in your lives. 
                It's been the trip of a lifetime and we'll see you a little ways down the 
                                                                road.
